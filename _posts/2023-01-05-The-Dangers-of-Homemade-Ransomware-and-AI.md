### Introduction 

With the advancement of technology, the digital world has become a fertile ground for numerous cyber threats. Among them, ransomware stands out for its devastating ability to hijack personal and corporate data, demanding ransoms for its release. In this article, we will explore how homemade ransomware can be created and the dangers they pose, even against systems equipped with the latest antivirus software. We will use practical examples of code that can transform a simple Python script into a powerful file encryption tool. We emphasize that this article is for educational purposes and aims to raise awareness about the capabilities and risks of modern technologies.

### Homemade Ransomware: A Real Threat 

Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom for data recovery. While many think that creating ransomware is something exclusive to sophisticated hackers, the reality is that anyone with basic programming knowledge can create homemade ransomware. This ease of creation makes this threat even more dangerous.

### Practical Example: File Encryption 
To illustrate how homemade ransomware can be created, we will use an example of Python code. The following code is designed to encrypt all files in a specific folder called `cow`, located on the user's desktop.Encryption Code (`encrypt.py`):



### File Decryption 
To decrypt the files, a corresponding decryption code is needed. Here is an example of code to decrypt the files encrypted in the `cow` folder.Decryption Code (`decrypt.py`):



### Lethality Against Next-Generation Antivirus 
In this example, polymorphism and AES-256 were used, and the password file was saved in the `cow` folder. However, the password could be a string sent to a C2 server or to the machine of a threat actor.
Even with next-generation antivirus installed, these scripts can be lethal. File encryption is a legitimate operation used by many security software to protect data. However, when used maliciously, it becomes a powerful tool for hijacking data.

Traditional antivirus may not immediately detect these scripts because:
 
1. **File encryption is not inherently malicious.**  Many legitimate programs, such as backup software, perform encryption operations.
 
2. **Obfuscation and polymorphism hinder detection.**  Polymorphic scripts change their appearance every time they are executed, making it difficult for antivirus to identify malicious patterns.
 
3. **The scripts are customized.**  Unlike widely disseminated malware, homemade scripts are unique and not in virus signature databases.

### Conclusion 
This article illustrates the dangers of homemade ransomware and how technology can be used to create encryption tools that, when misused, can have devastating consequences. The example of the `cow` folder shows how a simple script can encrypt data and demand a ransom for recovery. It is essential to remember that this content is for educational purposes and aims to raise awareness about the capabilities and risks of modern technologies.
In future articles, we will discuss how to mitigate these threats and protect your data against ransomware and other forms of malware.
