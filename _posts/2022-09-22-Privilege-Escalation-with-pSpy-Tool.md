Privilege escalation is a crucial technique in penetration testing and cybersecurity, allowing an attacker to gain access to functionalities and data that are normally not available to a standard user. One tool that stands out in this area is **pspy** – a process monitoring tool that requires no root privileges. In this article, we will explore the advanced use of pSpy to identify privilege escalation opportunities on Linux systems.

## Introduction to pSpy

**pspy** is a tool designed to help pentesters spy on running processes without the need to invoke commands like `ps`, which can be easily detected by security solutions or administrative logs. The tool is particularly useful in environments where the user does not have administrative permissions.

### Key Features

- **Discreet monitoring:** pSpy can observe running processes without needing special permissions.
- **Cron job detection:** capable of detecting scheduled tasks that can be exploited for privilege escalation.
- **Versatility:** available in multiple versions adapted to different system configurations.

## Installation and Configuration

Installing pSpy is straightforward. First, you should download the appropriate version of the tool from the [official pSpy GitHub page](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy).

```bash
# Download pSpy
wget https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.0/pspy64

# Make the binary executable
chmod +x pspy64
```

## Practical Usage

Once installed, pSpy can be run directly from the terminal. Here is an example of how to run pSpy to monitor processes and cron jobs on a system:

```bash
# Run pSpy to monitor processes and cron jobs
./pspy64
```

### Example Output from pSpy

```
2024/05/03 12:00:00 CMD: UID=0    PID=1133   | /usr/sbin/cron -f
2024/05/03 12:05:00 CMD: UID=1000 PID=1137   | /usr/bin/python3 /home/user/script.py
```

This output indicates that cron is running as root (UID=0) and a Python script is being executed by a standard user (UID=1000).

## Analyzing Privilege Escalation Opportunities

With active monitoring by pSpy, we can identify processes and tasks that may be exploited for privilege escalation. For example:

- **Modifying scripts executed by cron:** If a script run as root is writable by other users, it can be modified to execute malicious commands.
- **Exploiting insecure processes:** Processes running as root with known vulnerabilities can be potential targets.


### Advanced Monitoring with pSpy

pSpy not only monitors process execution in real time but can also be configured to watch for file creation and execution of specific scripts, thus increasing the chances of discovering security flaws or misconfigurations in systems.

#### Example: Monitoring Changes in Sensitive Directories

You can use pSpy to monitor changes in sensitive directories that might indicate the installation of a backdoor or the modification of an important configuration file. For example, if you suspect that the `/etc/cron.d` directory is being used to configure malicious cron jobs, you can monitor this directory for any new additions:

```bash
./pspy64 -d /etc/cron.d
```

#### Example: Identifying Insecure Scripts Executed by Cron

pSpy allows you to observe the execution of cron tasks, which are often configured to run as root. If a script executed by cron is stored in a directory where non-root users have write access, this could be an opportunity to insert malicious commands into the script. Here’s how you can identify these scripts:

```bash
# Typical output from pSpy showing cron tasks
2024/05/03 12:30:00 CMD: UID=0    PID=2053   | /bin/bash /etc/cron.daily/backup.sh
```

If you check and find that `/etc/cron.daily/backup.sh` is editable by other users, this could be exploited for privilege escalation.

### Using pSpy in Forensic Analysis

Besides identifying privilege escalation, pSpy can also be used for forensic analysis, helping to understand what an attacker did on a compromised system. For example, by observing the execution of commands immediately before a security incident, you can identify the attack vector and possible vulnerabilities exploited.

#### Example: Analyzing Suspicious Activity Before a Data Breach

```bash
# Monitor commands executed immediately before a known breach
./pspy64 -i 60 -f /var/log/auth.log
```

This command sets up pSpy to monitor processes that interacted with the `auth.log` file 60 seconds before a modification, helping to track suspicious activity related to the incident.

### Ethical Considerations

When using tools like pSpy, it is crucial to keep ethical considerations in mind. Use these tools only on systems where you have explicit permission to conduct penetration testing or forensic analysis. Unauthorized use of such tools can be considered illegal and unethical.

## Conclusion

pSpy offers a discreet and effective methodology for process monitoring in systems where the user does not have elevated privileges. It is an indispensable tool for cybersecurity professionals focused on vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

Responsible and ethical use of pSpy, as with any penetration testing tool, is crucial for promoting the security and integrity of information systems.
