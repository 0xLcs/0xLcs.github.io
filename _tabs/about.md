## About Me: Adventures of an Elite Pro Hacker
- **Elite Pro Hacker Status:** At Hack The Box, I've earned the title of Elite Pro Hacker, which, in layman's terms, means I've spent more hours deciphering codes than what might be considered normal. It’s a source of pride, but also a daily reminder that there’s always more to learn and new challenges to tackle!  
I am currently ranked in the `top 10 in Brazil` on the Hack The Box platform.

## Education and Training: A Journey of Constant Learning
- **Higher Education:** My journey began with a degree in Web Design from Universidade Anhembi Morumbi. Since then, I’ve dived into a variety of fields, collecting postgraduate degrees like someone collects stamps—from Cybersecurity, Data-Science, UX to Marketing, because diversity in learning is never too much!

## Specializations and Skills: Tools and Tricks of the Trade
- **Master of Penetration Testing:** I perform penetration tests to ensure that applications are as secure as they should be. With an array of tools from the classic Burp Suite to the robust Metasploit, I do everything to keep data secure.
- **DevSecOps Enthusiast:** As a true DevSecOps enthusiast, I integrate security from the start of development projects, ensuring every line of code is ready to face real-world challenges.
- **Expertise in Cloud Computing:** Whether it’s Azure or AWS, I handle cloud architectures with care and caution, ensuring that operations in the cloud are as secure as ground operations.

## Continuous Development: Keeping Curiosity Alive
- **Self-Study and Online Certifications:** The world of cybersecurity never sleeps, so neither do I! I stay engaged with courses and challenges on platforms like Hack The Box, where solving each problem is a personal victory and a learning experience.

## Pentest Toolkit: Prepared for Any Challenge
- **Tool Kit:** Equipped with everything from vulnerability scanners to network inspection software, I’m always ready to protect and serve (digitally speaking).

**Web Development**: Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and modern frameworks.
**Proficient in the following programming languages**: Bash, C/C++, C#, .NET/Powershell, Python, PHP, SQL, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Assembly.
